## üéØ Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of a "Dive into Augmented Reality" learning journey. It's designed to explore and demonstrate various AR capabilities and interaction patterns, serving as a foundation for understanding AR development concepts rather than a commercial application.

## üöÄ Features

### Core AR Functionality
- **Image Target Tracking**: Uses Vuforia for robust image target detection and tracking
- **3D Object Interaction**: Touch-based selection and manipulation of AR objects
- **Multi-Scene Navigation**: Switch between different AR experiences seamlessly

### Interactive Elements
- **Object Selection System**: Touch to select 3D objects in AR space
- **Real-time Material Changes**: Cycle through different materials/colors for selected objects
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Scale objects up or down with interactive buttons
- **Object Rotation**: Rotate selected objects with touch controls
- **Animated Characters**: Walking characters that respond to tracking status

### Scene Experiences
1. **Scene1**: Main AR interaction scene with object manipulation
2. **SceneRainbow**: Rainbow lighting effects and visual demonstrations
3. **SceneFrame**: Frame-based AR content display

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- **Unity 2022.3+**: Game engine for AR development
- **Vuforia Engine 10.27.3**: AR tracking and recognition
- **Unity XR Interaction Toolkit 2.6.3**: XR interaction framework
- **C# Scripting**: Custom behavior implementation

### AR Components
- Image targets for tracking
- 3D models (Barbarian, Sci-Fi Warriors, Low Poly Soldiers)
- Interactive UI buttons (Color, Size, Rotation controls)
- Video players for multimedia content
- Custom materials and shaders

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates understanding of:
- AR tracking and registration concepts
- Touch-based interaction in 3D space
- Unity's component-based architecture
- Vuforia SDK integration
- Mobile AR application development
- UI/UX design for AR experiences
